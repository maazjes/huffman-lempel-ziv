* The project uses Python. I can code in Python, Java, C# and JavaScript.
* The algorithms implemented include Huffman Coding and Lempel Ziv (LZ7). They mostly use depth first search and priority queue (heap).
* The goal is to compare the compressing power of text files with said algorithms.
* Inputs to the program are given as text files.
