# Specification

The goal of the project is to implement Huffman Coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression and decompression algorithms for text files and to compare them with eachother. Inputs to the program are given as text files or encoded binary files. The Existing data structures and algorithms used in the project include priority queue (heap), hash table and depth first search. The project is coded in Python but I can also evaluate other people's projects that are coded in Java, C# and JavaScript. Ideally, the time and space complexity of Huffman coding and LZW should be O(n).
