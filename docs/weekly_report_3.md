* I implemented Huffman and LZW algorithms to encode and decode strings and save them to .bin files.
* The project is progressing well. The next thing to do is proper unit tests and a simple interface for compressing text files.
* So far I've learned the concepts of Huffman and LZW algorithms. I know how they work and in what scenarios they work the best.
* The only unclear thing so far is how should I plan the unit tests. How many inputs should I use, how to test complex functions etc.
